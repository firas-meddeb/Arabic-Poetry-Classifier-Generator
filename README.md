# ArabicPoetryClassifierAndGenerator
The project consists of:
* Study of general trends in Arabic Poetry: An analysis based on word frequency for each era.
* Development of an AraBERT-based classifier to identify the era of an Arabic poem.
* Development of an automatic Arabic poem generator based on GPT-2.

All the links to the datasets and models we used can be found in the "Bibliography" section, at the end of the notebook [Arabic_Poetry_Classifier_&_Generator.ipynb]([docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/firas-meddeb/Arabic-Poetry-Classifier-Generator/blob/main/Arabic_Poetry_Classifier_%26_Generator.ipynb)https://github.com/firas-meddeb/Arabic-Poetry-Classifier-Generator/blob/main/Arabic_Poetry_Classifier_%26_Generator.ipynb).
